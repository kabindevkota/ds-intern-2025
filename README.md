| Skill               | 1â€“5 | Evidence / Notes |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------------- |
| Python              |  5  |  I have been using python as a main coding language since 2018 and have completed most of my projects in Python.    |
| Pandas / NumPy      |  4  |  I have taken data manipulation courses. I use pandas and numpy for all data-related projects.    |
| SQL                 |  3  |  I have done some SQL but I don't consider myself an expert. I can just get the things done if they are not too complex.                |
| Statistics          |  3  |  There is a lot to learn in statistics and I can't completely use the concepts and tools that I have learned fleuntly and naturally. So I am somewhat competent but not an expert.                |
| ML Algorithms       |  3  |   I know about the algorithms and have implemented some of them(not just used the libraries).        |
| Cloud (AWS/GCP)     |  1  |   Just heard about it and used it for class               |
| Git / GitHub        |  2  |   I have used it, I know the commands but I want to be able to do more               |
| Story-telling (viz) |  2  |   This would be my weak point because until now, I have only done this for a research paper and that's it. I understand that this is the most important skill for data science.               |
| Domain knowledge\*  |  4  |   I know about the tools and techniques used in data science. But I think I know more about exercising and workouts than any other domains. I have been training for more than 3 years now.         |
