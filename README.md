| Skill               | 1â€“5 | Evidence / Notes |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------------- |
| Python              |  5  |  I have been using Python as a main coding language since 2018 and have completed most of my projects in Python.    |
| Pandas / NumPy      |  4  |  I have taken data manipulation courses. I use pandas and numpy for all data-related projects.    |
| SQL                 |  3  |  I have done some SQL, but I don't consider myself an expert. I can just get the things done if they are not too complex.                |
| Statistics          |  3  |  There is a lot to learn in statistics, and I can't completely use the concepts and tools that I have learned fluently and naturally. So I am somewhat competent but not an expert.                |
| ML Algorithms       |  3  |   I know about the algorithms and have implemented some of them(not just used the libraries).        |
| Cloud (AWS/GCP)     |  1  |   Just heard about it and used it for class               |
| Git / GitHub        |  2  |   I have used it, I know the commands, but I want to be able to do more.               |
| Story-telling (viz) |  2  |   This would be my weak point because until now. Apart from making visualizations, I have not practiced story-telling from those charts and graph; I have only done this for a research paper, and that's it. I understand that this is the most important skill for data science.               |
| Domain knowledge\*  |  4  |   I know about the tools and techniques used in data science. But I think I know more about exercising and workouts than any other domain. I have been training for more than 3 years now.         |


## 1. Chosen Spike
### NLP
I believe Natural Language Processing has been the most impactful area in AI at present. It is fascinating how the technology behind it has been advancing rapidly. There has been a continuation of setting new benchmarks in language understanding, multilingual support, and conversational AI. This field has the capability of expanding rather than narrowing in the future due to multilingual expansion, real-time translation, and emotion-aware AI because human language has a lot of nuances to be encompassed completely.
